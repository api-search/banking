        Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync`
        rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same
        functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use
        for handling transactions updates.


        The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive
        user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some
        loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage
        may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use
        the [Investments
        endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead.
        Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in
        many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type,
        location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and
        returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information
        where available.


        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the
        sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. 
        Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the
        institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in
        `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted
        transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).


        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an
        Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset`
        parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body
        field to fetch all available transactions.


        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the
        Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid
        typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may
        occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution.
        To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item
        Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger)
        or call `/item/get`; the
        `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the
        timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check
        for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.


        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`.
        Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link
        was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to
        `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data
        is ready to be fetched, listen for the
        [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update)
        and
        [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update)
        webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is
        called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

      description: >-
        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint that initiates an
        on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The
        on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions
        that automatically occur one or more times per day for any
        Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added
        as a product in order to call `/transactions/refresh`.


        If changes to transactions are discovered after calling
        `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for
        `/transactions/sync` users,
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available)
        will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed.
        For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`,
        [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed)
        will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and
        [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update)
        will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can
        be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`.


        Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for
        Capital One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED`
        error if called on an Item from that institution.


        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency
        may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10
        seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter
        errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when

        The `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive
        a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and
        deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts.
        Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream
        including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can
        use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users
        better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay
        on track with bill payments.


        This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access
        to this endpoint, submit a [product access
        request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your
        Plaid account manager.


        This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been
        initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in
        `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or
        `/transactions/sync`). For optimal results, we strongly recommend
        customers using Recurring Transactions to request at least 180 days of
        history when initializing items with Transactions (using the
        [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested)
        option). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call
        `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions
        streams and subscribe to the
        [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update)
        webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you
        are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete)
        webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the
        payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the
        [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update)
        webhook.


        After the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get`
        endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of
        recurring streams. Listen to the
        [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update)
        webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

        The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all
        transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a
        stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already
        been seen.


        `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as
        `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to
        simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more
        about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync
        migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).


        This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`,
        `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account
        subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history
        from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get`
        instead.


        Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update,
        indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since
        the last call to the API.


        In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will
        return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up
        until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a
        `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor`
        to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.


        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an
        Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if
        additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction
        updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all
        updates, until `has_more` is `false`.


        When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the
        latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which
        `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to
        the
        [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination)
        error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning
        with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying
        only the single request that failed.


        Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available,
        `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks
        for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less
        frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find
        out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item
        Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger)
        or call `/item/get`; the
        `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the
        timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check
        for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.


        For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to
        `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the
        Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to
        several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions
        available.


        To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available)
        webhook.

        The `/processor/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive
        user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some
        loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage
        may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial
        institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name,
        entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is
        standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other
        meta information where available.


        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the
        sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. 
        Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the
        institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in
        `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and
        posted
        transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).


        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a
        processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and
        `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions`
        response body field to fetch all available transactions.


        Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data
        available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check
        for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times
        a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day,
        depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new
        transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh`
        endpoint.


        Note that data may not be immediately available to
        `/processor/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions
        data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or
        upon the first call to `/processor/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. If
        no transaction history is ready when `/processor/transactions/get` is
        called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.


        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook
        URL via the
        [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)
        endpoint.

        This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated
        webhooks for most common use-cases.


        The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to
        subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get
        updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track
        which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync`
        provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can
        be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process
        of tracking transactions updates.


        This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`,
        `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account
        subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history
        from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get`
        instead.


        Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update,
        indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since
        the last call to the API.


        In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor
        token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data
        associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call
        (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor
        token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the
        changes that have occurred since the previous call.


        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a
        processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies
        if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction
        updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor,
        pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.


        When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the
        latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which
        `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails
        when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the
        [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination)
        error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning
        with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying
        only the single request that failed.


        Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available,
        `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid
        typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may
        occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution.
        To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the
        `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.


        Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be
        immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins
        preparing transactions data when the corresponding Item is created, but
        the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to
        complete, depending on the number of transactions available.


        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook
        URL via the
        [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)
        endpoint.

        `/processor/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of
        the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch
        the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction
        takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically
        occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor
        token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling
        `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for
        `/transactions/sync` users,
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available)
        will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed.
        For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and
        `/processor/transactions/get`,
        [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed)
        will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and
        [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update)
        will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can
        be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or
        `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the
        `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital
        One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error
        if called on a processor token from that institution.


        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency
        may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10
        seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter
        errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when
        making requests.


        `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to
        Transactions and has a separate [fee
        model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access
        to this endpoint, submit a [product access
        request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your
        Plaid account manager.

        The `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers
        to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams
        (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card
        accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring
        stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more.
        Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that
        help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce
        spend, and stay on track with bill payments.


        This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access
        to this endpoint, submit a [product access
        request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your
        Plaid account manager.


        This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already
        been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it
        in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling
        `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`). Once
        all historical transactions have been fetched, call
        `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring
        Transactions streams and subscribe to the
        [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update)
        webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you
        are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the
        [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete)
        webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the
        payload is `true`. If using `/processor/transactions/get`, listen for
        the
        [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update)
        webhook.


        After the initial call, you can call
        `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the
        future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to
        the
        [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update)
        webhook to be notified when new updates are available.


        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook
        URL via the
        [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)
        endpoint.

      description: >-
        The `/investments/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to
        retrieve up to 24 months of user-authorized transaction data for
        investment accounts.


        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the
        sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.


        Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions
        associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and
        offset parameters in conjunction with the
        `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all
        available investment transactions.


        Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial
        transaction data has loaded (unless you use the `async_update` option).
        Instead, if transactions data is not ready when
        `/investments/transactions/get` is first called, Plaid will wait for the
        data. For this reason, calling `/investments/transactions/get`
        immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.


        Data returned by the asynchronous investments extraction flow (when
        `async_update` is set to true) may not be immediately available to
        `/investments/transactions/get`. To be alerted when the data is ready to
        be fetched, listen for the `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook. If no
        investments history is ready when `/investments/transactions/get` is
        called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

        Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle

        categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related
        errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will
        be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will
        only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item
        status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred;
